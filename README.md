# WebPanel-Core
This is the Core for the new Webpanel.

It already contains 90% of the features the old WebPanel contained
and even some the old WebPanel did not contain.

If you are brave enough you can use the new WebPanel for your store installation.

## Aim of the Project
The Aim of this Project is to change the Framework from the quite dated Codeigniter 2.1 to Laravel 5 which is currently developed actively.
